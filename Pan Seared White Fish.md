## Ingredients 
- 2 white fish fillets (such as cod, halibut, or tilapia)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 lemon, sliced
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh herbs (such as parsley or dill), chopped for garnish

## Instructions 

1. Pat the fish fillets dry with a paper towel and season both sides generously with salt and pepper.

2. Heat the olive oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat.

3. Once the oil is hot, carefully place the fish fillets into the skillet skin side down if they have skin on. If your fillets don't have skin, it doesn't matter which side goes down first.

4. Cook the fish for about 4-5 minutes without disturbing it to allow a nice crispy crust to form. Adjust the heat if needed to avoid burning.

5. Flip the fish gently using a spatula and cook for an additional 3-4 minutes until it is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork. Cooking times may vary depending on the thickness of your fillets.

6. In the last minute of cooking, add minced garlic to the skillet and saut√© briefly until fragrant but not burned.

7. Remove the skillet from heat and squeeze fresh lemon juice over each fillet.

8. Transfer the pan-seared white fish to serving plates or a platter, garnish with fresh herbs, and serve immediately while hot.

Pro tip: Pan-seared white fish pairs well with steamed vegetables or a fresh salad as sides. Additionally, you can serve it alongside rice pilaf or roasted potatoes for a more substantial meal.

Enjoy your deliciously pan-seared white fish!
