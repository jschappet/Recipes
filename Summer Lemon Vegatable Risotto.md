Ingredients:
	8 ounces asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces
	8 ounces sugar snap peas, trimmed and cut in half
	5 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
	1 (8-ounce) zucchini, halved lengthwise and cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices
	1 (8-ounce) yellow squash, halved lengthwise and cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices
	4 3/4 cups organic vegetable broth
	1/2 cup finely chopped shallots
	1 cup uncooked Arborio rice
	1/4 cup dry white wine
	1/2 cup (2 ounces) grated fresh pecorino Romano cheese
	1/4 cup chopped fresh chives
	1 teaspoon grated lemon rind
	2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
	1 tablespoon unsalted butter
	1/4 teaspoon salt

Instructions:
	Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil. Add asparagus and peas; cook for 3 minutes or until crisp-tender. Drain and rinse under cold water.
	Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add 2 teaspoons olive oil to pan; swirl to coat. Add zucchini and squash to pan; cook for 7 minutes or until lightly browned, stirring occasionally. Set aside.
	Bring vegetable broth to a simmer in a medium saucepan (do not boil). Keep warm over low heat.
	Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add shallots, and cook for 3 minutes or until tender.
	Stir in rice, and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly.
	Stir in wine; cook until liquid is absorbed (about 30 seconds), stirring constantly.
	Stir in 1 cup broth; cook 5 minutes or until liquid is nearly absorbed, stirring constantly.
	Reserve 1/4 cup broth. Add remaining broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly until each portion of broth is absorbed before adding the next (about 22 minutes total).
	Stir in vegetables; cook 1 minute or until thoroughly heated.
	Remove from heat; stir in reserved 1/4 cup broth and remaining ingredients.
