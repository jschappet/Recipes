# Sweet Potato Brownies

## Ingredients

   1 large sweet potato
   1/2 cup almond flour
   1/2 cup cocoa powder
   1/2 cup maple syrup
   1/4 cup melted coconut oil
   1 tsp vanilla extract
   1 tsp baking powder
   1/4 tsp salt
   Optional: vegan chocolate chips, chopped nuts

## Instructions

  Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C) and line a baking dish with parchment paper. Peel and chop the sweet potato into small pieces, then steam or boil until soft.
  Mash the sweet potato in a bowl until smooth.
  Add the almond flour, cocoa powder, maple syrup, melted coconut oil, vanilla extract, baking powder, and salt to the bowl with the sweet potato. Mix well until smooth.
  Fold in the chocolate chips or chopped nuts, if using.
  Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish and smooth out the top with a spatula.
  Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
  Allow the brownies to cool in the pan for at least 10 minutes before cutting and serving.
