## Ingredients
	100g of whole raw eggs (2)  
	35g of olive oil 
	70g of lemon juice   
	70g of honey  
	160g of milk  
	100g of cream  
	2g vanilla extract (1/2 tsp)  
	A pinch of salt   
  
## Instructions
  
1. blend all ingredients together until smooth. Churn with available equipment. Personally, I used the Ninja Blender creamy, but here are some other options:  
	1. double bag with ice method (Google it)  
	2. freeze mixture into ice cube tray, blend in a high-speed blender like a Vitamix 
2. if you have a weaker blender, freeze 70% of the mixture, then blend with remaining liquid mixture. Will not be as thick, but a very delicious milkshake.  
  
- use a traditional style ice cream maker
