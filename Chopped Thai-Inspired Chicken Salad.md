## INGREDIENTS


**Thai Chicken Salad**

- 3–4 cups cooked shredded **chicken**
- 1 head of **green cabbage** (3–4 cups shredded)
- 1–2 large **carrots** (2 cups grated)
- 1 green **papaya** or **mango** (1–2 cups grated) **_(optional)_**
- 1 cup fresh **cilantro**, chopped
- 1/2 cup **peanuts**, chopped
- 1/2 cup **green onions**, sliced
- 3–4 **red serrano peppers**, sliced
- **salt** and **lime juice** to taste

**Peanut Dressing**

- 1/2 cup **peanut butter**
- 1/3 cup low sodium **soy sauce**
- 1/3 cup **sesame oil** (toasted or dark)
- 1/4 cup **rice vinegar**
- 2 tablespoons **sambal oelek** _(sriracha works, too)_
- 2 tablespoons **sugar**
- a small knob of fresh **ginger**, peeled
- a clove of fresh **garlic**, peeled
- _1/4 cup water to thin to desired consistency_

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Chop:** Put on some good music, pour a drink, and start choppin’!
2. **Dressing:** Pulse all ingredients in the food processor or blender. Adjust consistency with water.
3. **Thai Chicken Salad Assembly:** Toss the salad ingredients in a big bowl with a drizzle of peanut dressing so everything gets coated. Season with salt and lime juice, and maybe a shot of fish sauce if you’re feeling wild. Serve chilled.

### NOTES

**Chicken:** Pulled rotisserie chicken works great. You can also cook chicken breasts in the Instant Pot (12 minutes, with about a cup of water, plus salt and pepper) and then shred them.

**Cabbage:** You want the cabbage to be very thin, like it would be for coleslaw. I did this with a mandoline.

**Vegetarian:** You can make this with tofu instead of chicken! Just follow one of the methods in [this post](https://pinchofyum.com/how-to-cook-tofu).

**Leftovers / Make Ahead:** You can keep this for a few hours once it’s tossed with dressing – like if you make it for lunch, it’ll be pretty okay for dinner. But for best results, keep the leftover salad and dressing separate until ready to serve.
