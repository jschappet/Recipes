Ingredients:
[For noodles]
	3 tablespoons sesame seeds
	1/4 cup vegetable oil
	2 tablespoons finely chopped peeled ginger
	1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic
	10 oz fresh shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and thinly sliced
	1 1/4 pound Napa cabbage, thinly sliced (8 cups)
	6 scallions, thinly sliced
	8 to 9 ounces soba (buckwheat noodles)
	1 cup frozen shelled edamame

[For Sauce]
	1/3 cup water
	1/3 cup soy sauce
	2 to 3 teaspoons Korean hot-pepper paste (sometimes labeled "gochujang")
	1 tablespoon packed brown sugar

Instructions:
	Stir together all sauce ingredients until brown sugar is dissolved, then set aside.
	Toast sesame seeds in a dry 12-inch heavy skillet (not nonstick) over medium heat, stirring, until pale golden, then transfer to a small bowl.
	Heat oil in skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then sauté ginger and garlic, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
	Add shiitakes and sauté, stirring frequently, until tender and starting to brown, about 6 minutes. Reduce heat to medium, then add cabbage and most of scallions (reserve about a tablespoon for garnish) and cook, stirring occasionally, until cabbage is crisp-tender, about 6 minutes.
	Add sauce and simmer 2 minutes.
	While cabbage is cooking, cook soba and edamame together in a pasta pot of boiling salted water (2 tablespoons salt for 6 quarts water) until noodles are just tender, about 6 minutes.
	Drain in a colander and rinse under cool water to stop cooking and remove excess starch, then drain well again. Transfer to a large bowl and toss with sesame seeds and vegetable mixture. Serve sprinkled with reserved scallions.

Notes: 
If you aren't able to find Korean hot-pepper paste, substitute 3/4 teaspoon Chinese chile paste and reduce the amount of soy sauce to 1/4 cup.

Use portabella mushrooms instead - maybe a touch too hot or needs a bit more sweet, but great first try
