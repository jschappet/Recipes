	1/2 teaspoon salt
	1/4 teaspoon black pepper

## Instructions 
1. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook the spaghetti according to package directions.
2. While the spaghetti is boiling, prepare the sauce by first heating the butter and olive oil over medium heat.
3. Once the butter has melted add the garlic and let it cook for a minute or so stirring continuously.
4. Pile the spinach in the pan (it will seem like a lot, but it will cook down quickly) and stir it around so that it wilts.
5. Add the nutmeg and give it all a big stir
6. Once the pasta is done cooking first reserve a few tablespoons of the starchy water before draining. 
7. Add the pasta to the spinach.
8. Add the cream and goat cheese and, using tongs, toss all of it together until the cheese has melted and everything is well coated in the sauce.
9. If needed, add some of the starchy water to thicken the sauce.
10. Season with salt and pepper.
