## Ingredients

- 4 lbs whole chicken see additional cook times below
- ¼ cup unsalted butter room temperature
- 1 teaspoon dried parsley
-  1 teaspoon seasoning salt I use Lawry’s
-  3/4 teaspoon garlic powder
-  1/2 teaspoon black pepper
-  ¼ teaspoon paprika
-  1 1/2 cups low sodium chicken broth
-  1 onion quartered
-  1 lemon quartered, optional

### Instructions

- Unwrap your chicken and remove any bag from the inner cavity if there is one. Gently loosen the skin but do not remove it.
    
- In a small bowl, combine butter, parsley, seasoning salt, garlic powder, pepper, and paprika. Spread butter evenly under the skin of the chicken.
    
- *At this point, you can cook or freeze. To freeze, wrap in plastic wrap and place chicken in a large freezer bag. Freeze for up to 6 months. Follow cook times in recipe notes to cook from frozen, or thaw before cooking and follow remaining steps. 
    
- Place the trivet in the Instant Pot and add chicken broth. Add chicken and place onion and lemon quarters around and under the chicken if desired (the lower pieces of chicken will absorb the lemon flavor, so don’t use it if you don’t want that). 
    
- Put the lid on and set the valve to sealing. Set the Instant Pot to manual, high pressure (the default), and 32 minutes (or 8 minutes per pound of chicken). It will take about 15 minutes to come to pressure and begin counting down.
    
- When it is done cooking, turn the Instant Pot off and let pressure release naturally for 5-10 minutes before moving the valve to venting and releasing remaining pressure.
    
- Open the lid and insert a meat thermometer into 3 or 4 places where the meat is the thickest. Be sure that it reaches 165 degrees F in all places. Peel the skin off the chicken (or move to a broiler to brown if desired). Serve.
