## INGREDIENTS

	6 ounces dry noodles (brown rice noodles, pad thai style rice noodles, soba noodles, linguini)

	4 cups mix of red cabbage, carrots and radish, shredded or grated
	1 red bell pepper, finely sliced
	3 scallions, sliced
	1/2 bunch cilantro, chopped (or sub basil and mint)
	1 tablespoon (or less, or more) jalapeño, finely chopped
	1/4–1/2 cup roasted, crushed peanuts ( optional garnish)

### Thai Peanut Sauce ( You may not need all- so save extras for another use.)

	5 thin slices ginger- cut across the grain, about the size of a quarter.

	2 cloves garlic
	1/2 cup peanut butter ( or sub almond butter!)
	1/2 cup fresh orange juice ( roughly 1 large orange)
	1/3 cup fresh lime juice ( roughly 2 limes)
	1/4 cup soy sauce or GF Braggs Liquid Amino Acids (Note: Tamari will turn this unpleasantly dark)
	1/3 cup honey, agave, or maple syrup
	1/4 cup toasted sesame oil
	1 – 1 1/2 teaspoons cayenne pepper ( or a squirt of sriracha sauce)

	1 teaspoon salt

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. Cook Noodles: Cook pasta according to directions on package. ( See notes for rice noodles) Drain and chill under cold running water.
2. Blend the Peanut Sauce: while noodles are cooking, blend the peanut sauce ingredients together using  a blender until smooth.
3. Toss: Place shredded veggies, bell pepper, scallions, cilantro and jalapeño into a serving bowl. Toss. Add the cold noodles to the serving bowl and toss again. Pour some peanut sauce over top and toss well to combine- no need to use all, just use enough to coat well. ( Save the extra sauce for any leftover salad-as it can soak up the sauce overnight.)

Taste: Adjust the salt (to your liking), add chili flakes if you want, or more lime, and serve, garnishing with roasted peanuts and cilantro and a lime wedge.

## NOTES

Noodles:  If cooking pad thai style rice noodles, add the noodles to a pot of boiling water. Turn heat off, stir and let steep 2-3 minutes until tender, drain and run under cool water. Alternatively, pour boiling water over the noodles in a baking dish, let soak until softened, drain.
Salad will keep 4 days in the fridge.
