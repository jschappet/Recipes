	1 1/2 Tbsp quality olive-oil
	Juice from 1 or 2 lemons
	1/2 tsp ground cumin
	1 clove of garlic – peeled and chopped
	1/2 tsp salt
	Black-pepper – freshly ground – to taste
	1/2 lb. Tahini (find at Ethnic section of supermarket). Note that the Tahini should be made out of 100% sesame seeds – no additives.
	1/2 tsp sugar

## Instructions:
	And that’s how you make the Hummus:
	Pour the chickpeas into the blender, along with ½ a cup of the can’s liquids.
	Add garlic, salt, black-pepper, cumin and sugar.
	Start the blender, until you get a smooth mixture.
	Add the Tahini, olive-oil and lemon-juice, and blend again. The mixture should be thin, but not too thin. Add some more of the chickpea liquids if it’s too thick.
	Let the mixture cool down, and eat with a pita-bread. Bon-appetit!
