Ingredients:
	1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
	1 cup chopped onion
	One 8-ounce Yukon gold potato, peeled and cut into 1/3-inch cubes
	One 8-ounce yam (red-skinned sweet potato), peeled and cut into 1/3-inch cubes
	4 large cloves garlic, flattened, peeled and chopped
	4 large tomatillos (8 to 9 ounces), husked, rinsed, cored and chopped
	2 large poblano chiles (8 to 9 ounces), stemmed, seeded; 1 diced, 1 cut into 4 strips
	2 tablespoons dried Mexican oregano
	1 tablespoon chickpea flour
	2 teaspoons cumin seeds
	Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
	One 28-ounce can hominy with juices (preferably golden)
	1 cup vegetable broth
	One 7-ounce can diced mild green chiles
	Garnishes, such as crumbled feta cheese, chopped green onions, sliced avocados, lime wedges and chopped serrano chiles)

Instructions:
	Heat the oil in a heavy, large pot over medium heat.
	Add the onions, potatoes, yams, garlic, tomatillos and poblanos.
	Cover and sweat until the onions are tender, stirring often to prevent browning, about 8 minutes. Mix in the oregano, flour, cumin, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.
	Add the hominy with the juices and the broth and bring the chili to a simmer.
	Place the green chiles in a processor. Using tongs, transfer strips of the poblano chile from the pot to the processor; blend just until smooth.
	Scrape the chile sauce into the pot.
	Cover and simmer the chili 20 minutes. Uncover and simmer until the potatoes and yams are tender and the chili is reduced to desired consistency, stirring often, 20 to 25 minutes longer. Season with more salt and pepper if desired.
