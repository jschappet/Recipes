## Ingredients 
- 1 lb (450g) boneless, skinless chicken breasts, thinly sliced
- 1 red bell pepper, sliced
- 1 green bell pepper, sliced
- 1 yellow onion, thinly sliced
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons lime juice
- 2 teaspoons chili powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- Salt and black pepper, to taste
- Flour tortillas, for serving

### Optional toppings 
- Sour cream or Greek yogurt
- Shredded cheese (Cheddar or Monterey Jack)
- Salsa or pico de gallo
- Guacamole or sliced avocado

## Instructions 

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the olive oil, lime juice, minced garlic, chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika, salt, and black pepper. Mix well to create a marinade.

2. Add the thinly sliced chicken breast to the marinade. Toss until all the pieces are evenly coated with the marinade. Cover the bowl and let it marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense flavor, you can marinate it for up to 4 hours.

3. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add one tablespoon of olive oil. Once hot, add the sliced bell peppers and onion to the skillet. Sauté for about 5 minutes until they become slightly tender but still have a crunch. Remove from heat and set aside.

4. Using the same skillet over medium-high heat with another tablespoon of olive oil added if necessary; cook the marinated chicken slices until they are browned on both sides and cooked through completely. This usually takes about 5 to 7 minutes.

5. Once the chicken is cooked, return the sautéed bell peppers and onions to the skillet. Stir everything together to combine well and allow the flavors to meld for an additional 2 minutes.

6. Warm the flour tortillas according to package instructions. You can either heat them in a dry skillet for a few seconds on each side or wrap them in foil and warm them in the oven.

7. Place a generous amount of the chicken fajita mixture onto each warmed tortilla. Add any desired toppings such as sour cream, shredded cheese, salsa, guacamole,
