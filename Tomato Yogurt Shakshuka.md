Ingredients:
	2 tablespoons olive oil
	1 teaspoon harissa (add more if desired)
	2 teaspoons tomato paste
	2 large red peppers, diced
	4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
	1 teaspoon ground cumin
	1 28-ounce can of diced or crushed tomatoes
	6 eggs
	1/2 cup labneh or Greek yogurt

Instructions:
	In a large saucepan -- ideally a pan you can cover with a lid later -- warm the olive oil over medium heat and then add the harissa, tomato paste, red peppers, garlic, cumin, and roughly 1/2 teaspoon salt.
	Saute for about 10 minutes, until the peppers soften. Add the tomatoes, bring to a simmer and cook for another 10 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened. Make a half-dozen little indentations in the sauce and then crack an egg into each.
	Simmer until the whites are gently set and the yolks are still wobbly; this will take around 10 minutes, but watch closely--the eggs go from undercooked to overcooked quickly.
	(If they're cooking very slowly, cover the pan and then peek.) Serve the eggs in the sauce, with the labneh or yogurt on the side. You'll want bread and a simple green salad.
