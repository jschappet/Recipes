Ingredients:
	8 slices brioche loaf or egg bread, toasted
	4 large tomato slices
	8 radicchio leaves
	tarragon mayonaise

	1/2 cup dry breadcrumbs
	1 tablespoon butter

	1 pound skinless salmon fillet, cut into 1/4-inch pieces (about 2 1/4 cups)
	4 green onions, chopped
	1 tablespoon drained small capers
	1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
	1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon or 1 teaspoon dried
	1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
	1 teaspoon prepared white horseradish
	1/2 teaspoon salt
	1/2 teaspoon pepper

Instructions:
[To make burgers]
	Combine first 9 ingredients in medium bowl. Add 3 tablespoons mayonnaise and mix well. (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
	Mix breadcrumbs into salmon mixture. Form into four 1-inch-thick patties. Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add salmon patties; cook until just firm to touch and brown and crusty, about 3 minutes per side.

[To assemble]
	Place 1 slice of toast on each of 4 plates. Top each with burger. Spread burgers generously with mayonnaise. Top each with tomato slice, 2 radicchio leaves and second toast slice. Serve immediately, passing remaining mayonnaise separately.
