## Ingredients 
	4 ripe bananas (up to 2 cups mashed)
	2 eggs
	1/2 cup coconut sugar (1/2 to 1 cup to taste)
	1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, melted
	1 cup coconut milk or coconut cream
	1 teaspoon vanilla extract
	1 cup almond meal
	1 cup arrowroot powder
	2 teaspoons baking powder
	1/2 teaspoon baking soda
	1/2 teaspoon salt
	2 teaspoon ground coriander (optional)

## Instructions 
1. This makes 2 loaves. Preheat oven to 350. In a large bowl, mash bananas well. 
2. Add eggs, sweeteners, melted butter, coconut milk and vanilla. Mix well. 
3. Add almond meal and arrowroot, baking powder, guar gum, baking soda, salt and optional coriander. 
4. Mix well. Batter will be thin. Pour into 2 greased loaf pans. 
5. Bake approximately 40 minutes, or until toothpick inserted in middle tests clean. 
6. Refrigerate. This is pretty chewy while warm, but firms up after refrigeration and tastes very yummy. 
7. Add some nuts for added flavor and texture.
