## Ingredients
	1 tablespoon butter, divided
	2 cloves garlic, minced
	1 tablespoon minced shallot
	1 cup crimini mushrooms, wiped clean, stems removed, and sliced
	1 cup Brussels sprouts, bottoms trimmed and sliced thin
	3 eggs
	1 tablespoon heavy cream
	1/4 – 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
	several twists of fresh ground black pepper
	3 tablespoons Gruyere, grated or sliced thin

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
2. Heat half of the butter in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and shallot, and sauté for a minute. Next, add the mushrooms, sprouts, and a good sprinkle of sea salt and sauté, stirring a bit, for about 4 minutes.
3. The mushrooms and sprouts should be soft and will have released a bit of their water.
4. Place the remaining butter in a small 6 inch ramekin or baking dish, and set in the oven until the butter is melted and bubbly. Remove from the oven.
5. Swirl the melted butter in the ramekin, and then spoon in the sauteed vegetables. Drizzle in the cream and crack the eggs into the dish. Top off with a pinch of sea salt and a twist or two of pepper.
6. Place in the oven and bake for 5 minutes. Working quickly, pull the ramekin, and add the cheese to the top. Return to the oven and cook for 1 – 2 minutes more, or until the whites are just set.
7. Keep in mind that the eggs will continue to cook a bit once out of the oven. Pull, and set aside to cool for a minute or two, and serve.
